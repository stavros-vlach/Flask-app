The dataset used is the **Social Network Ads dataset**, which contains user demographic information (Gender, Age, Estimated Salary) and whether the user purchased a product after seeing an advertisement.  

Target variable:  
- `Purchased` â†’ 1 if the user purchased the product, 0 otherwise.

A **Machine Learning web application** built with Flask and deployed on Render.  
The app uses a **Logistic Regression model** (scikit-learn) to predict whether a user is likely to purchase a product after viewing an advertisement, based on:

- Gender (male/female)

* Age

+ Estimated Salary
